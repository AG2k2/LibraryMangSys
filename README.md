# LibraryMangSys
My first real project with laravel. where a library can manage the borrowing operations from users or guests.

It basically let a user to register and wait until one of librarians submit his registeration so he can borrow books.

librarinas can check for borrowing requests. And, when a student get his book form the library, a librarian submits that and a return date is initially set until the book is returned.
